### Zombies and humans
What do we know about zombies?

Zombies are slow and easy to kill. They are extremely dangerous when gethered in large groups.
They like hiding behind every corner, and if they bite you, you become a zombie too, so be careful.

In Horddays, zombies try to be as close to this description as possible, although, in addition,
they slightly differ in the way the perceive the world:

- The green, Oddy, can hear.
- The red, Sniffy, can smell.
- The blue, Spotty, can see.

These undead fellows horde and walk around. Unless you have enough weapons, try to avoid large groups.

Each level is a day in your life. To survive it, you have to find the exit.

The main character is a hoader - he (or she) cannot drop items at will, so to get rid of something,
you really have to use this something. Also, you cannot rearrange the inventory and have to use 
the first item from the stack. This is another constraint you have to deal with.

### Controls
`Numpad`, `vim keys`  walk

`f`, `Ctrl`  use the item   

`Space`, `Num5`  wait   

`q` quit   

### Items
Medkit, Antidote, Rock, Grenade, Pistol, Smell-vision device (Olfactovisor), Loudspeaker.

### To build and run

      $ make
      $ ./horddays

### License
