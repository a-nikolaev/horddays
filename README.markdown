### Zombies and humans
What do we know about zombies?

Zombies are slow and easy to kill. They are extremely dangerous when gathered in large groups.
They like hiding behind every corner, and if they bite you, you become a zombie too, so be careful.

In **Horddays**, zombies try to be as close to this description as possible, although, in addition,
they slightly differ in the way the perceive the world:

- The green, Oddy, and can hear.
- The red, Sniffy, can smell.
- The blue, Spotty, can see.

These undead fellows horde and move together. Unless you have enough weapons, try to avoid large groups.

Finding an Exit, is the only way to survive a day. 
Your goal is to survive as many days as possible. 

The main character is a hoader - he (or she) cannot drop an item at will, so to get rid of something,
you really have to use this something. Also, you cannot rearrange the inventory and have to use 
the first item from the stack. This is another constraint you have to deal with.
